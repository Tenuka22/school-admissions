"""School-aware name matching for Google Maps scrape results.

A naive "compact names are nearly identical" check misses legitimate matches
where Google spells the same school differently -- abbreviations (K.V. ->
"Kanishta Vidyalaya"), qualifiers ("National School", "(Girls) College"),
zone prefixes ("G/ ..."), and Sinhala romanisation variants ("Kanitu
Viduhala", "Vijayabahu"/"Wijayabahu", "thth"/"tt") -- while still refusing
landmarks, businesses, people and other schools (e.g. "Karandeniya Central
College" must not satisfy "Warukandeniya K.V.").

Ported from the Galle government-school map scraper
(apps/map-scraper/src/match_logic.py in the aloysius-g1 repo), where the
rules were tuned offline against 123 real rejected pairs from a scrape of
429 Galle schools. Generalised here for the full nationwide listing: the
Galle-district coordinate bounding box is dropped (out of scope for a
national scrape), everything else - type-family conflicts, village-only
matches, non-school markers, location corroboration - applies unchanged.
